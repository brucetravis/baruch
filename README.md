 // return clearInterval(interval) // this is cleaned up immediately and not after the image is unmounted







✅ Imports from Framer Motion — a popular animation library.

motion: Lets you turn normal HTML elements (like <div>) into animated ones.

useAnimation: A hook that gives you full control over the animation — like starting or stopping it programmatically.

useInView: A hook that detects if a component is visible (in view) in the browser viewport. Useful for scroll-based animations.


useRef()	🎯 Targets a specific DOM element, like <div> or <section>.
useInView()	👀 Watches that element to detect when it's in the viewport.
useAnimation()	🎬 Gives you full manual control to start the animation (not automatic).


# 🔁 How They Work Together:
useRef() points to your component (e.g. ref={ref} on a <motion.div>).

useInView(ref) keeps watching that specific component.

When inView === true, the useEffect() block starts the animation using controls.start(...).

✅ useInView(ref, { once: true })
This is a hook from Framer Motion that tells you whether the element you're referencing (with ref) is currently visible on the screen (i.e., in the user's viewport).


🧠 Parameters Explained:
1. ref
This is the reference to a specific element you want to watch.

You defined it with useRef(null) just above this line.

For example, you're saying: “Watch this particular div — and tell me when it becomes visible.”

2. { once: true }
This means: “Only trigger true the first time this element comes into view — after that, don't trigger again.”

This is useful for animations, so they only happen once (not every time you scroll up and down).


📦 Final Meaning of the Line:
You're asking Framer Motion:
“Tell me when the element with this ref is visible on screen, and only notify me the first time it happens.”

if (inView) {
  controls.start({ opacity: 1, y: 0 });
}


# So when inView becomes true, you trigger the animation once.


# ✅ What This Means for You
You can wrap any component (text, images, sections, etc.) in your SlideInOnScroll like this:



<SlideInOnScroll>
  <section className="about-us">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We deliver fresh chicken to your doorstep.</p>
  </section>
</SlideInOnScroll>


const controls = useAnimation();

✅ **Create animation controller**

- This gives you **manual control** to start, stop, or update the animation.
- You will use it to trigger the "slide in" animation only **when** the component is in view.

---

### ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView) {
      controls.start({ y: 0, opacity: 1 });
    }
  }, [inView, controls]);


🧠 Why This Matters:
inView will change from false to true when the element scrolls into the viewport.

controls is the animation instance that manages the start or stop of animations.




# ✅ Run animation when component comes into view

useEffect runs when inView or controls change.

If inView is true, it triggers controls.start() to animate the component to:

y: 0 → slide it to original position (was at y: 100 initially).

opacity: 1 → make it fully visible.




✅ **React Hooks**

- `useEffect`: Runs code at specific points in a component's lifecycle (e.g. when it mounts or updates).
- `useRef`: Lets you reference a DOM element or value across renders without re-rendering.



✅ Component Declaration

You're creating a reusable component called SlideInOnScroll.

children is a special prop that allows you to pass nested content (e.g. JSX) into this component.


const ref = useRef(null);


✅ **Create a reference** to the HTML element.

- `ref` will point to the DOM element you're animating.
- It's used with `useInView` to check if this specific component is on-screen.

---

### ```js
  const inView = useInView(ref, { once: true });


✅ Detect if component is in view

inView is true if the ref element is visible in the viewport.

{ once: true } ensures the animation only runs once, not every time it scrolls into view.



return (
<motion.div
ref={ref}
initial={{ y: 100, opacity: 0 }}
animate={controls}
transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: 'easeOut' }}
>
{children}
</motion.div>
);
}


✅ **Render the animated div**

- `<motion.div>`: A special `div` that supports animation props.
- `ref={ref}`: Attach your `ref` so that `useInView` can monitor its position.
- `initial`: The starting animation state.  
  - `y: 100`: Start 100 pixels lower (off-screen).
  - `opacity: 0`: Start invisible.
- `animate={controls}`: Tells it to animate using your manual control.
- `transition`: Sets how the animation plays — here it lasts `0.8s` with a smooth ease-out curve.
- `{children}`: This allows any content inside `<SlideInOnScroll>...</SlideInOnScroll>` to appear with the slide-in effect.

### ✅ **Summary: What This Component Does**

`SlideInOnScroll`:
- Watches when it scrolls into view.
- When visible, it **animates from below (y: 100) to its original position (y: 0)**.
- It **fades in** by going from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`.
- The animation **only runs once** when the component first enters view.
- You can reuse it to animate any element:  
  ```jsx
  <SlideInOnScroll>
    <h2>Welcome to My Site</h2>
  </SlideInOnScroll>




# Scroll Restoration
<ScrollRestoration /> only works with:

createBrowserRouter()

RouterProvider

# They are called data routers

🧠 These two are data routers:
createBrowserRouter()

A function used to define routes with data loading (loader, action, etc.)

Part of React Router's Data APIs (v6.4+)

<RouterProvider />

The component that provides the router created by createBrowserRouter() to your app.


✅ How to Fix It
Since you're using a basic setup, just remove <ScrollRestoration /> completely from your App.js and instead:

✅ Use the ScrollToTop solution I gave you above — it's fully compatible with your setup and doesn’t depend on any data router.
